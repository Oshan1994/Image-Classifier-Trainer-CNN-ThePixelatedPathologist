## Weights & Licenses

This repository **does not distribute** pretrained weights. On first run,
the code downloads official weights from upstream providers (Keras/TensorFlow
or TorchVision) into a user cache. You agree to upstream license terms when
selecting a given model.

- Keras/TensorFlow models: downloaded via Keras Applications at runtime.
- TorchVision models: downloaded via TorchVision weight enums at runtime.


No datasets are included. This project is for **non-commercial/research** use.
